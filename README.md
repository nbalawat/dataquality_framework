Data Quality Validation Framework - Feature Summary
This document provides a comprehensive list of all the features added to the Data Quality Validation Framework since its inception. The framework is designed to perform data quality checks on BigQuery tables and is configurable via a YAML file. Below is a detailed summary of the features implemented.

1. Configuration-Driven Checks
1.1. Support for Multiple Check Types
Null Checks: Verify that specified columns do not contain null values beyond a defined threshold.
Uniqueness Checks: Ensure that specified columns contain unique values, with an allowable threshold for duplicates.
Conditional Checks: Validate that records meet specified conditions (e.g., amount > 0).
Anomaly Detection: Detect anomalies in row counts over time, both at the table level and within specified groups.
1.2. YAML Configuration File
Customizable Checks: All checks are defined in a config.yaml file, allowing for easy customization without modifying the code.
Table-Specific Configurations: Define different checks for each table, including filters and thresholds.
Group Anomaly Detection Settings: Configure historical data points, minimum data points, anomaly thresholds, and filters for group-based anomaly detection.
2. Enhanced Anomaly Detection
2.1. Group By Anomaly Detection with Filters
Filter Clauses in Group Checks: Ability to specify filter conditions in group anomaly detection checks to narrow down the data analyzed.
Flexible Grouping: Support for multiple groupings (e.g., by region, date) with individual configurations.
2.2. Historical Data Storage
Row Count History Table: Stores historical row counts per group for anomaly detection, allowing the framework to compute expected values based on historical trends.
3. Detailed Result Recording
3.1. Inclusion of Generated SQL Queries
Transparency: All generated SQL queries used in the checks are saved in the results, providing full transparency into the operations performed.
Debugging Aid: Availability of SQL queries aids in debugging and validating the checks.
3.2. Unique Run Identification and Timestamps
Run ID Generation: Each execution of the framework is assigned a unique run ID based on the timestamp.
Run Metadata Recording: Start time, end time, status (success or failure), and error messages are recorded for each run.
Timestamping Results: Each result record includes a timestamp indicating when the check was performed.
4. Consolidation of Results
4.1. Unified Results Table
Single Data Quality Results Table: All check results are stored in a unified data_quality_results table in BigQuery.
Comprehensive Schema: The results table schema accommodates all check types and relevant metadata.
Simplified Reporting: Consolidation facilitates centralized reporting and analysis.
5. Modular Code Structure
5.1. Code Organization into Logical Modules
config_loader.py: Handles loading and parsing of the configuration file.
data_quality_checks.py: Contains functions for executing data quality checks and anomaly detection.
main.py: Serves as the orchestrator script that brings together the configuration and check execution modules.
5.2. Improved Maintainability
Separation of Concerns: Modular code improves readability and makes it easier to maintain and extend the framework.
Reusability: Functions are organized logically, promoting code reuse.
6. Extensive Testing Capabilities
6.1. Generation of Comprehensive Test Data
Multiple Test Tables: Creation of several BigQuery tables (transactions, users, sales, and edge case tables) with dummy data covering various scenarios.
Edge Case Handling: Inclusion of tables with empty data, all nulls, and all duplicates to test the framework's robustness.
6.2. SQL Scripts for Data Generation
Automated Data Population: Provided SQL scripts to generate and populate test tables with data that intentionally includes anomalies, nulls, duplicates, and conditional violations.
7. Enhanced Configuration Options
7.1. Filter Conditions in Checks
Flexible Filtering: Ability to specify filter conditions in the configuration for all check types, allowing checks to be performed on subsets of data.
Conditional Complexity: Support for complex conditions in conditional checks to accommodate various data validation rules.
8. Error Handling and Logging
8.1. Robust Error Management
Exception Handling: Errors during check execution are caught and recorded, with the script continuing to process other checks.
Error Messages in Results: Any errors encountered are included in the results for transparency.
8.2. Detailed Logging
Execution Logs: Logging of key events, including the start and end of runs, errors, and other significant actions.
Log Configuration: Logging is set up to output to the console, aiding in real-time monitoring during execution.
9. Schema Definitions for BigQuery Tables
9.1. Data Quality Results Table Schema
Comprehensive Fields: Includes fields such as run_id, dataset, table, check_type, metric_name, metric_value, status, generated_sql, and timestamps.
Support for All Check Types: Schema accommodates null checks, uniqueness checks, conditional checks, and anomaly detection results.
9.2. Row Count History Table Schema
Historical Data Storage: Stores historical row counts for groups used in anomaly detection.
Fields Included: Contains run_id, dataset, table, group_by_columns, group_values, row_count, and timestamps.
9.3. Data Quality Runs Table Schema
Run Metadata Recording: Records metadata about each execution run, including start time, end time, status, and error messages.
10. Packaging and Distribution
10.1. Code Consolidation
Ready-to-Deploy Files: All code files (config_loader.py, data_quality_checks.py, main.py, configuration files, and SQL scripts) are organized for easy distribution.
Zip Archive Preparation: Instructions provided for consolidating all files into a zip file for download and deployment.
11. Documentation and Summarization
11.1. Requirements Summary
Markdown Documentation: A comprehensive summary of all requirements and features implemented, documented in a markdown file.
Clarity and Accessibility: Documentation ensures that users and developers can easily understand the framework's capabilities and usage.
12. Security and Best Practices
12.1. Credential Management
Secure Authentication: Instructions for setting up Google Cloud credentials securely, avoiding hardcoding sensitive information.
Permissions: Guidance on ensuring the service account used has the necessary permissions for BigQuery operations.
12.2. Error Handling
Fail-Safe Execution: The script is designed to handle errors gracefully, logging them and continuing execution where appropriate.
13. Scheduling and Automation
13.1. Integration with Argo Workflows
Containerization: Instructions for creating a Dockerfile to containerize the script for deployment.
Workflow Definition: Guidance on defining and deploying an Argo Workflow YAML file to schedule regular data quality checks.
14. Performance Considerations
14.1. Efficient Data Handling
Batch Inserts: Recommendations for inserting results into BigQuery in batches to handle large datasets efficiently.
Retry Logic: Implementation of retry logic in query execution to handle transient errors.
15. Extensibility
15.1. Framework Customization
Adding New Checks: The modular design allows for easy addition of new check types as needed.
Configuration Extensions: The YAML configuration can be extended to include new parameters and settings.
